abstract="Selective retina therapy (SRT) is a laser treatment targeting specific posterior retinal layers. It is focused on inducing damage to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), while sparing other retinal tissue compared to traditional photocoagulation. However, the targeted RPE layer is invisible with most imaging modalities and induced SRT lesions cannot be monitored. In this work, imaging scans acquired from an experimental setup that couples the SRT laser beam with an optical coherence tomography (OCT) beam are analyzed in order to evaluate the treatment as they occur.",
